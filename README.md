This project was to build an French-English translator using word embeddings, bi-directional encoder, and decoder with attention in PyTorch.

An conceptual overview of the project is described in <a href=https://macbrennan90.github.io/neural-translation-model.html>this blog post</a>.

A detailed walk through of the code used to build the model can be found in the translation-model.ipynb, Jupyter Notebook. A rendered version of the notebook can be viewed <a href=https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/macbrennan90/translation-model/blob/master/translation-model.ipynb>here</a>.

The blog post and notebook are intended to complement each other. The post outlines the reasoning behind the steps taken in the notebook, while the notebook demonstrates how these concepts are implemented in code.
